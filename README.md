=======================================================================


INSTALLATION:
=======================================================================
- Drop the /resource/ folder into your steamapps/Sven Co-op/svencoop_hd  or  /svencoop_addon  folder
- Choose one of the numbered background folders and rename it to just: background
- Take your pick, each background is a remake of the old Sven Co-op menu backgrounds from each version up to version 4.0. All of them have a preview image so you can see what it looks like off-game
- The 4.0 background is the original but enhanced version of it, and has no preview (it looks the same as we know it)
